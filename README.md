# Twitter Clone MERN App

## Project Description

This Twitter Clone web application was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a primary focus on security, real-time communication, and advanced social interaction features. The application enables users to create accounts, post tweets (text and images), follow/unfollow other users, like, comment, and engage in chat conversations using Socket.io.
